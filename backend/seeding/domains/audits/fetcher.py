"""Audit domain fetcher with live OAG report integration.

Strategy (in order):
1. If live_pdf_fetch_enabled, try to discover the latest audit report
   PDFs from the OAG (Office of the Auditor General) website.
2. Fall back to the static fixture / configured URL.

Known limitation: OAG report PDFs are scanned images
-----------------------------------------------------
Most published OAG audit reports are scanned (raster) PDFs with no
embedded text, so pdfplumber's ``extract_text`` returns empty and
the live path produces zero findings. Probed 2026-04-26: the home
page links one matching "performance-audit" PDF (32 MB, scanned)
plus an Annual Corporate Report (text but doesn't match the audit
keyword filter); the per-category listings
(/national-government-audit-reports/, /county-governments-reports/,
/financial-audit-reports/) are JS-rendered and don't expose PDFs in
raw HTML.

Two paths to actually solve this, both larger scope than this file:

* Add an OCR pipeline (pytesseract + pdf2image, plus
  apt-installed tesseract-ocr + poppler-utils in CI). Heavy on
  runtime — OCR is ~2-5 sec/page and an OAG report is 100+ pages.
* JS-render the per-category listing pages with Playwright to find
  text-based PDFs — assumes any exist; we haven't confirmed.

Until one of those lands, the live path here will keep returning
None and the fixture is authoritative. The "no extractable text"
log used to fire as WARNING; it's INFO now because the fallback
works correctly and a real warning would be misleading on every
nightly run.
