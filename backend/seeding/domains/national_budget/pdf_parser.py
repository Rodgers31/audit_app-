"""Parser for the COB National Government BIRR PDF (Tables 2.5 + 2.6).

Why this exists
---------------
The national_budget domain originally piped the discovered NG-BIRR
PDF through ``CoBQuarterlyReportParser``, which is anchored on a
47-county invariant. That works for the *Consolidated County* BIRR
but not for the National Government BIRR — different document with
no per-county breakdown — so the parser raised
``TableNotFoundError`` and the domain silently fell back to fixture.

This parser targets two consolidated tables that DO exist in the
NG-BIRR:

* **Table 2.5** ("Sectoral Development Estimates and Exchequer
  Issues") — sub-table 0: 10 sectors × {Net Estimates, Exchequer
  Issues, %} for the current period and the comparative prior period.
* **Table 2.6** ("Sectoral Recurrent Estimates and Exchequer
  Issues") — sub-table at index 1: same shape, recurrent side.

Both have a clean 7-column layout:

    | Sector | NetEst | ExchIss | % | NetEst (prior) | ExchIss (prior) | % |

Sectors are coded by short tags (ARUD, EIICT, GECA, GJLO, PAIR,
EPWNR, SPCR + literal "Health" / "Education" / "National Security"),
with a "Total" row at the bottom.

Caveats
-------
* The NG-BIRR publishes **Exchequer Issues** at the sector level,
  not actual Expenditure. Exchequer Issues is the cash released by
  Treasury — the closest sector-level proxy for spending we have.
  We map it to ``actual_spent`` and call out the proxy in record
  notes. (Per-Vote actual Expenditure lives in the section-4
  sectoral analysis tables; harvesting that requires walking ~10
  per-sector tables and aggregating — a follow-up.)
* Values in the bulletin are KShs Billion; we scale to whole KShs
  to match the fixture's amount-in-shillings convention.
* Period detection reads the cover page descriptor
  ("FIRST SIX MONTHS", "FIRST QUARTER", etc.) and the FY label
  ("FY 2025/2026"). Annual reports are detected when neither a
  half/quarter/nine-months descriptor appears.
