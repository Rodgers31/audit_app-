"""Fetcher for Kenya national-government debt data.

Strategy
--------
1. Load the fixture as the baseline payload — it covers every lender
   we display (multilateral, bilateral, commercial, domestic) with
   reasonable values that move slowly.

2. Overlay World Bank IDS rows on top of the baseline. WB IDS is the
   only machine-readable per-creditor source for Kenya external debt
   (see wb_ids.py for why CBK + Treasury PDF paths were retired).
   Any lender we successfully fetch from WB UPDATES the matching
   fixture row in-place; lenders WB doesn't break out (specific
   bilateral countries) keep their fixture values.

3. Domestic debt — currently still on the fixture. CBK Statistical
   Bulletin parsing for live domestic data is queued as a follow-up
   (the relevant table on page 57 of the bulletin lays months
   horizontally inside one cell, so it needs a more involved parser
   than the counties_budget approach).

Why we dropped the CBK PDF discovery path
-----------------------------------------
The original `_fetch_from_cbk_pdf` scraped
https://www.centralbank.go.ke/public-debt/ for "debt-bulletin"
PDFs. CBK's content reorganization left that page with five PDFs,
none of which are debt bulletins (auction rules, repo agreement,
diaspora remittances, etc.). The CBK Public Debt Statistical
Bulletin moved into the broader CBK Statistical Bulletin under
/releases/statistical-bulletin/ and the published format is now
aggregated by instrument type, not by lender — so even a successful
discovery wouldn't have given us the per-loan rows the original
parser expected. See PR #75 for the full investigation.
