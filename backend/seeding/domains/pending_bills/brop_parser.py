"""Parse pending bills from the National Treasury BROP.

Why BROP and not the COB NG-BIRR
--------------------------------
The pending_bills domain was originally piped through the COB
National Government BIRR (NG-BIRR), but that report has zero
pending-bills tables — confirmed by walking the FY 2025/26 H1 PDF's
TOC and full text. The four pages that mention the phrase use it
incidentally inside Annex II Article 223 emergency-exchequer
justifications, not as published data. So the prior fetch+parse
path was structurally wrong (and the "derive pending = allocated −
absorbed" formula it fell back on was a non-sequitur — that's
unspent budget, not unpaid obligations).

Treasury's annual **Budget Review and Outlook Paper** (BROP),
published every September/October, is the cleanest live source:

* **Paragraph 18** carries the national aggregate split — total
  National Government pending bills, broken into State Corporations
  and MDAs. Three numbers in narrative prose; we extract via regex.
* **Table 10** ("County Governments Pending Bills as at 30th June
  YYYY") carries 47 per-county rows with County Executive
  {Recurrent, Development, Sub-Total} + County Assembly
  {Recurrent, Development, Sub-Total} + Total. We extract via
  text-mode parsing because pdfplumber's ``extract_tables`` returns
  31 columns of misaligned soup on this layout.

Caveats
-------
* **Annual cadence** (October). Fresh county-side data is published
  more frequently in the COB Consolidated County BIRR; that's a
  follow-up overlay using the same WPDM discovery from PR #78.
* The narrative para-48 cites "cumulative pending bills" of KSh
  195.5 B (statutory + payroll deductions included) but Table 10
  reports KSh 176.9 B. Table 10 is the audited per-county breakdown
  and what we persist; the 18.6B delta lives in the narrative only.
* National-side detail is sparse — BROP only publishes the two-line
  MDA-vs-SOE split, not per-MDA. Per-MDA pending bills require OAG
  audit OCR and stay on fixture for now.
