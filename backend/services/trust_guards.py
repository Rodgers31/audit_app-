"""Lightweight trust/plausibility alerts for production (April 2026).

Each check returns a list of human-readable notes suitable for surfacing
in an API response's ``_meta.quality_notes`` field, and emits a WARNING
log line when a threshold is crossed. Keep every check pure — no DB
writes, no external calls — so they're safe to run inside request
handlers behind ``@cached`` decorators.

Callers are expected to:

1. Pass the already-aggregated data (sectors list, totals, etc.) to
   the relevant checker.
2. Merge the returned notes into ``_response_meta(quality_notes=...)``
   so the frontend can show a single "data quality" badge.
3. Trust the log side-channel (WARNING level with the "TRUST:" prefix)
   for ops alerting — Datadog / CloudWatch filters on that prefix.

None of the checks raise. A check failing to run should *never* take
down an endpoint — degrade silently and emit a WARNING.
