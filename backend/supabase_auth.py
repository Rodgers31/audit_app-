"""
Supabase JWT authentication for FastAPI admin endpoints.

The legacy ``backend/auth.py`` is HS256 against a local SECRET_KEY and
is no longer in use — the frontend authenticates against Supabase
directly. This module verifies the JWTs Supabase issues so that
admin endpoints have real auth (not the env-gated no-op the existing
admin routers had via ``ADMIN_API_AUTH_REQUIRED``).

How it works
------------
Modern Supabase projects sign access tokens with an asymmetric key
(ECC P-256 / ES256 by default in 2025+). The private key never leaves
Supabase; the public key is published at
``<SUPABASE_URL>/auth/v1/.well-known/jwks.json`` and we verify
against that — fetched once, cached for an hour, refreshed on a
``kid`` cache miss.

A pre-2024 project that still uses the legacy symmetric secret
(HS256, ``SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET``) is supported as a fallback: if the
token's header carries ``alg=HS256`` and the env var is set, we
verify symmetrically. New ECC-signed tokens take the JWKS path.

After verifying the signature we pull the user's ``sub`` claim
(their UUID) and query the ``profiles`` table for their ``roles``
array to authorise. The frontend's ``AuthProvider`` reads roles
from the same column, so the two stay in sync.

Why we don't trust roles in the JWT itself
------------------------------------------
Supabase's default JWT only carries a ``role`` claim of
``"authenticated"`` (the Postgres role). App-level roles like
``"admin"`` live in our own ``profiles.roles`` column. We could
mirror them into ``app_metadata`` and read from the JWT, but that
adds a write path that has to stay synchronised with the DB. One
source of truth is simpler.
