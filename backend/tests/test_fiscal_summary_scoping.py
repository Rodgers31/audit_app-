Tests for FiscalSummary-backed and dashboard endpoint scoping.

 - /dashboards/national/fiscal-outturns uses FiscalSummary (not BudgetLine)

 - /dashboards/national/sector-ceilings filters by entity type matching the
   period scope (national-only when national period is used).
 - /budget/enhanced execution_by_sector is period-scoped for the national entity.
